/*
Write a while loop that prints userNum divided by 2 (integer division) until reaching 1. 
Follow each number by a space. Example output for userNum = 40:

20 10 5 2 1

Note: These activities may test code with different test values. 
This activity will perform four tests, with userNum = 40, then with userNum = 2, then with userNum = 0, then with userNum = -1. 
See "How to Use zyBooks".

Also note: If the submitted code has an infinite loop, 
the system will stop running the code after a few seconds, 
and report "Programend never reached." The system doesn't print the test case that caused the reported message.
